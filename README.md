# twilio-project

Old project of mine that serves as a framework to create a text bot that sends messages and responds to commands. 
This one gets Bitcoin prices and texts you about it. Note: does not include everything needed to run it (e.g. Twilio API keys, script to tell Twilio how to set up the webhooks correctly, etc.
